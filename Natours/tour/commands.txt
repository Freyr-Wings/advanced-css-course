7-1 ARCHITECTURE

BASE: This file will be for the real low level basics,
such as resets and styles for the HTML
and body element selectors.
Note this file should be a partial
so we can later import it into the main SASS file.

ABSTRACTS: In this folder we're only going to put code
that's not going to output any css.
We already saw what type of code is that:
variables, mixins, and stuff like that.

COMPONENTS: In that folder we're then going to create
one file for each of our components.
Remember, that components are our reusable building blocks
that make up our website or apps.
They should also be usable anywhere on the page
so that they are completely independent
and held together by the layout of the page.

LAYOUT: we also need a layout folder for
each piece of the global layout of the entire project.
In the layout folder, we're going to have a
global footer, header, et cetera...so stuff like that.

PAGE: if you have very specific styles
for a specific page, like for example, a homepage;
we can then create a new file for that specific page

THEME: web apps with different themes
VENDORS: put third party css. e.g. bootstrp
